If you haven't tried the micro-challenge yourself, do it.  It is fun, you can create reasonably strong solutions in only 5 minutes, and you'll appreciate other solutions more if you try it yourself.\n\n\n---\n\n# Strategy\n\nThis solution uses an optimization technique called **dynamic programming**.  **Dynamic programming** starts by solving an optimization problem in a very limited scenario, and then creates an iterative rule to expand to larger problem.\n\nIn our case, we first solve for the optimal price when you only have 1 day to sell tickets before the flight.  Then we continually step back to longer time-horizons one day at a time.\n\nThis solution highlights two of the most important ideas from the fields of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning.  \n- The **value function** returns the best outcome achievable from any input state.  In our case, **V(tickets_left, days_left)** returns the best revenue you can expect to achieve given the number of tickets you have and the number of days left before the flight.\n-  The **Q Function** is similar to the value function. But it includes your decision as an input, and it returns the expected revenue even if that is not based on an optimal decision policy.\n\nThe distinction may become clearer when you see it in practice below. \n\nThe output of the Q function for **T+1** days before the flight depends how much revenue is the sum of \n- revenue from flights sold that day\n- revenue earned in the last **T** days from the remaining tickets.\n\nDaily revenue is straightforward to calculate (as you'll see below.)  Since we calculate **Q** and the value function (denoted **V**) start near flight time, and then iteratively work backwards, we can look up revenue from the last **T** days from the value function.\n\nOnce we have **Q** at time T+1,  we calculate **V** on that day by looking up the revenue associated with the best decision from **Q**.\n\nAgain, this should become clearer as you see it in code.\n\n# The Base Case: Selling Tickets For a Single Day\n\nYou want to maximize revenue, given the knowledge that \n> quantity_sold = demand_level - price\n\nYou may want to keep the price high rather than sell all remaining tickets. So, this problem is not as trivial as finding the price to sell all available tickets.  Instead, you will go back to find the price and quantity pair that maximize \n> revenue = price * quantity_sold\n\nIt's easier to think about optimization in terms of a single choice variable, rather than using an equation that explicitly includes both `price` and `quantity_sold`. To do this, first rearrange the `quantity_sold` equation above with simple algebra to solve for price:\n> price = demand_level - quantity_sold\n\nPlug this expression for price into the revenue equation and you have\n> revenue = (demand_level - quantity_sold) * quantity_sold\n\n*note: you could also express revenue entirely in terms of price instead of quantity, but would make a later steps a little messier.\n\nSince `demand_level` is just a known number when you make your daily price decisions, you can plot revenue as an equation that depends only on the quantity you sell. \n\nFor the sake of an example, here is the plot when `demand_level` is 150.\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ndemand_level = 150\n# only plot quantities up to demand_level.
